        <p>I do not intend to speak about, I only wish to speak nearby is a fiction based on the movie The Gleaners and I by Agnès Varda. This documentary deals with issues of wealth and poverty in modern day France by exploring the world of gleaners. Varda explores the narrative with the intention to “glean” memories and events through the use of her DV camera, not only creating a connection with the act of gleaning but also with the viewers. 
        </p>

        <p>This type of involvement as the main vehicle for perception perfectly describes what haptic vision emcompasses. Haptic vision thus works as the “other side” of perception, delivering knowledge that is felt rather than thought. Through haptic vision there is no need for stereotypical foundations or preconceived ideas of what a person or a community are.
        </p>

        <p>This storytelling strategy allows the viewer to come into contact with the elements showcased through their own memories and recollections, instead of using a set of external and pre-established concepts, disrupting any attempt of fetishization and hostility.

        <div class="text2"><p>The role of fiction in design is increasingly more important as time goes by. It’s because of it that we are capable of developing scenes that allow us to understand certain realities better and grasp what the designer’s role is, in its creation.</p>

        <p>Through our motto, <i>hacking reality</i>, we intend to create a fiction based on current issues. Deriving from Agnès Varda’s film, <i>The Gleaners and I</i>, our project aims to explore how to build the identity of a person through non verbal queues.
        </p>

        <p>This type of identity formation uses the concept of haptic vision, which prevents viewers from coming into contact with the elements with pre-established external notions, and instead allowing them to make contact with the objects through their own memories and experiences stored in their senses, having an active position in the meaning’s assembly.

        <p>For the project’s teaser we wanted to explore how different cultures can relate to each other because of their habits and rituals. As it is showcased on the video, different parts of the world share the same mannerisms and customs, not only showing the diversity that is often hidden behind certain cultural stereotypes but also disclosing how these behavioral aspects of different people improve our perception of marginalized groups and how we are much more united than we think.</p>
